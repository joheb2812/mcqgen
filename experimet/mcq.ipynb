Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life.[1][2][3] Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce.[1][2][3] Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.[1][2][3][4][5]\\n\\nBiologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization,[1] from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations.[1][6] Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use.[7][8][9] Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them.[1]\\n\\nLife on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago,[10] is immensely diverse. Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.', 'number': 5, 'subject': 'Machine Learning', 'tone': 'simple', 'response_json': '{\"1\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"2\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"3\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}}', 'quiz': '```json\\n{\\n  \"1\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"What is the central unifying theme that explains the diversity of life on Earth?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"Energy processing\",\\n      \"b\": \"Cellular organization\",\\n      \"c\": \"Evolution\",\\n      \"d\": \"Homeostasis\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"c\"\\n  },\\n  \"2\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"Which of the following is NOT a characteristic shared by all living organisms?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"They are made of cells.\",\\n      \"b\": \"They process hereditary information.\",\\n      \"c\": \"They are capable of photosynthesis.\",\\n      \"d\": \"They regulate their internal environment.\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"c\"\\n  },\\n  \"3\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"What is the approximate age of the oldest known life forms on Earth?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"1 billion years\",\\n      \"b\": \"2 billion years\",\\n      \"c\": \"3.7 billion years\",\\n      \"d\": \"5 billion years\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"c\"\\n  },\\n  \"4\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"Which of these is an example of a eukaryotic organism?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"Archaea\",\\n      \"b\": \"Bacteria\",\\n      \"c\": \"Fungus\",\\n      \"d\": \"Virus\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"c\"\\n  },\\n  \"5\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"What is a key aspect of how biologists study life?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"They only focus on macroscopic organisms.\",\\n      \"b\": \"They use only observational studies.\",\\n      \"c\": \"They utilize the scientific method.\",\\n      \"d\": \"They ignore the molecular level of life.\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"c\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'review': '```json\\n{\\n  \"1\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"What is the central unifying theme that explains the diversity and unity of life, as mentioned in the text?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"Energy processing\",\\n      \"b\": \"Cellular organization\",\\n      \"c\": \"Evolution\",\\n      \"d\": \"Homeostasis\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"c\"\\n  },\\n  \"2\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of all living organisms according to the text?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"They are made up of cells.\",\\n      \"b\": \"They process hereditary information.\",\\n      \"c\": \"They are capable of photosynthesis.\",\\n      \"d\": \"They regulate their internal environment.\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"c\"\\n  },\\n  \"3\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"According to the text, what is a major process that enables organisms to move, grow, and reproduce?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"Homeostasis\",\\n      \"b\": \"Evolution\",\\n      \"c\": \"Energy processing\",\\n      \"d\": \"Cellular respiration\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"c\"\\n  },\\n  \"4\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"The text mentions several levels of biological organization that biologists study.
